## What This Command Does

### Create Issue (`/issue create "text"`)

1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Checks available repository labels first
   - Presents analysis of your input
   - Shows proposed title, type, and validated labels
   - Displays structured description preview
   - Asks for confirmation before creating

2. **Issue Analysis**:
   - Identifies issue type (bug, feature, enhancement)
   - Extracts key problems or requirements
   - Detects technical details (file sizes, error messages, browsers)
   - Recognizes user impact and priority

3. **Title Generation**:
   - Creates concise, searchable title
   - Includes key technical details
   - Under 60 characters
   - Action-oriented when appropriate

4. **Description Structure**:
   - **Bug Reports**:
     - Problem summary
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected vs actual behavior
     - Technical environment
     - Error messages/logs
   - **Feature Requests**:
     - Feature overview
     - User story/use case
     - Proposed implementation
     - Acceptance criteria
     - Impact/benefits

5. **Label Validation**:
   - Checks available repository labels with `gh label list`
   - Maps suggested labels to existing ones
   - Only applies labels that exist in the repository
   - Warns if suggested labels don't exist

6. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Creates issue with `gh issue create`
   - Assigns validated labels only
   - Sets priority if detected
   - Returns issue number and URL
